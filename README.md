# GeoPolAI
an AI bot whose expertise is Geo-politics &amp; International Relations
The code defines two functions:

* query_llm: This function takes a prompt as input and sends it to the LLM API. It returns the generated response from the LLM.
* handle_input: This function takes user input as a string, preprocesses it, and then queries the LLM using the query_llm function. It then prints the response from the LLM.

The main loop of the code continuously prompts the user for input and then calls the handle_input function to process the input and generate a response.

This bot can be used to answer various questions about geopolitics and international relations, such as:

* What are the current major geopolitical trends?
* What are the implications of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine?
* What is the future of the European Union?
* What are the challenges facing the United States in the 21st century?
